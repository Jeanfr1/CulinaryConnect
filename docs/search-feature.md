# Search and Discovery Feature Implementation

## Overview

The search and discovery feature allows users to find recipes and other users on the CulinaryConnect platform. It provides a comprehensive search experience with filtering, sorting, and trending content discovery.

## Components

### Main Components

1. **Search Page** (`src/app/search/page.tsx`)

   - Main search interface with tabs for recipes and users
   - Handles search queries, filtering, and sorting
   - Displays search results and trending content

2. **RecipeCard** (`src/components/RecipeCard.tsx`)

   - Displays recipe information in a card format
   - Handles recipe interactions (like/unlike)
   - Links to recipe details and author profiles

3. **UserCard** (`src/components/UserCard.tsx`)

   - Displays user information in a card format
   - Handles user interactions (follow/unfollow)
   - Links to user profiles

4. **TagSelector** (`src/components/TagSelector.tsx`)
   - Allows selection and filtering of tags
   - Displays popular tags and search suggestions
   - Handles tag selection and deselection

## Database Functions

The feature relies on several PostgreSQL functions in Supabase:

1. **search_recipes**

   - Searches recipes by title, description, or tags
   - Returns public recipes matching the search criteria

2. **search_users**

   - Searches users by username or display name
   - Returns user information with recipe and follower counts

3. **get_popular_tags**

   - Returns the most frequently used tags in recipes
   - Used for tag suggestions and filtering

4. **get_trending_recipes**
   - Returns trending recipes based on likes and recency
   - Uses a formula to balance popularity and freshness

## User Experience

### Recipe Search

1. Users can search for recipes using keywords that match titles, descriptions, or tags
2. Results can be filtered by:
   - Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
   - Tags (selected from popular tags or search)
3. Results can be sorted by:
   - Newest first
   - Oldest first
   - Most liked
   - Least liked
4. When no search is performed, trending recipes are displayed

### User Search

1. Users can search for other users by username or display name
2. Results show:
   - User profile information
   - Recipe count
   - Follower count
3. Users can follow/unfollow directly from search results

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Local React state for search parameters, filters, and results
- Redux for user authentication state
- URL parameters for shareable search queries

### Data Fetching

- Supabase RPC calls for database functions
- Optimized queries with appropriate filters and limits
- Parallel data fetching for related information (author details, like status)

### UI/UX Considerations

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Error handling with user feedback
- Dark/light mode support

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Queries**

   - Using database functions for optimized searches
   - Limiting result sets to reasonable sizes

2. **Pagination**

   - Limiting initial result sets
   - Future enhancement: Implement infinite scrolling

3. **Caching**
   - Popular tags and trending recipes can be cached
   - Future enhancement: Implement client-side caching

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**

   - Filter by cooking time, ingredients, cuisine
   - Nutritional information filters

2. **Personalized Recommendations**

   - Based on user preferences and history
   - Collaborative filtering algorithms

3. **Search Analytics**

   - Track popular searches
   - Improve search relevance based on user behavior

4. **Voice Search**

   - Implement voice input for search queries

5. **Image Search**
   - Allow users to search by uploading food images

## Conclusion

The search and discovery feature provides a robust foundation for users to find content on the CulinaryConnect platform. It balances functionality with performance and offers a user-friendly interface for exploring recipes and connecting with other users.
